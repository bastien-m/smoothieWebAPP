#Smoothie WebAPP

##Objectives
This App used the Smoothie Backend in order to work. The aim of this project is to provide a simple app design to help people to find a smoothie they could do without needing to buy something more than what they have in their kitchen.

##What you need to do
Just type your available fruits and this web app will perform a search and list all the recipes available. Simple as that.

##Functions (and ideas not implemented yet)
You are able to add recipes as well, judge other recipes (and maybe get some tips and proposals, not implemented yet)


##help
If you have ideas or you want to help me (I'm not a designer so a designer is welcome)
you are welcome :) Send me a request on github and I'll be happy to grant you access to my project.
