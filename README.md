#Smoothie WebAPP

This App used the Smoothie Backend in order to work. The aim of this project is to provide a simple app design to help people to find a smoothie they could do without needing to buy something more than what they have in their kitchen.

Just type your availables fruits and this web app will perform a search and list all the recipes availables. Simple as that.


You are able to add recipes as well, judge other recipes (and maybe get some tips and proposals, not implemented yet)
